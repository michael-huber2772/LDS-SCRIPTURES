# Psalm 100

##### 1
 MAKE a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.
##### 2
 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.
##### 3
 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
##### 4
 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.
##### 5
 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.
