# Psalm 121

##### 1
 I WILL lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.
##### 2
 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.
##### 3
 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.
##### 4
 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
##### 5
 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.
##### 6
 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
##### 7
 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.
##### 8
 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.
