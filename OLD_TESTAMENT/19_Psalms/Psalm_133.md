[<< Psalm 132](OLD_TESTAMENT/19_Psalms/Psalm_132.md) | [Psalm 134 >>](OLD_TESTAMENT/19_Psalms/Psalm_134.md)

# Psalm 133

##### 1
 BEHOLD, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
##### 2
 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;
##### 3
 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
